# springboot-springmvc-app
This project will show you an example of Spring MVC and Spring Boot Application which works as crud application. In this project I didnt provide any database or ORM like hibernate , I just use hashmaps to store data without any details of database or ORM. So you can just run it by jvm and then it uses Thymleaf as template engine for view layer . This is not a real full detail project it's just a lightweight for learning purpose. you can ask your questions by aliseylaneh@gmail.com.
